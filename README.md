# React Router V6 Study

This project is a study case. I'm taking a project created with react-router-dom V5 and converting it to V6 in order to learn how to integrate the new routing into my other apps/sites.

## Version 6 - React Router

The new version or React Router comes with a few improvements and breaking changes. The most notable is the way we declare routes. This changes how we do nested routes, use redirects and, we no longer have the switch compnent. By the end of this study, I plan to be able to comfortable upgrade existing React projects and incorporate v6 into new projects.
